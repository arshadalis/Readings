## Assembly language programming
Telling computer actual steps to perform. copy this from memory and put it into register and then jump somewhere.
very imperative way of programming.
this programs do not scale.

## Procedural programming
Write procedures, which takes some arguments and return some thing. Chop down bigger task in smaller one.
Abstract way of programming.

## Object oriented programming
More general way of programming. One level above of abstraction. Object oriented programming is about
thinking in terms of objects. objects are the first class citizen.
Objects hides the implementation and abstract over the interface it provides to access its data or behaviour.
Object oriented programming is composing these objects together to achieve bigger functionalities.
Objects are the means of communication between objects.

There is one problem with them Object oriented programming, it does not perform well with concurrency
and parallel programming. It is because the very nature of OOP, it hides mutation of fields inside.
Also in OOP objects mutate state of each other. To control mutation then it uses locks. But the locks are hidden
as well and they do not compose.
