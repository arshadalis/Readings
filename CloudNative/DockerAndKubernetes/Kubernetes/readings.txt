Kubernetes is the OS of cloud native apps. provides reliable and scalable platform for containerized apps.


=> Architecture

Control plane is the heart of the kubernetes cluster. The nodes which has control plane are called Master nodes.
Kubernetes uses etcd database to store all te cluster info.
There are multiple master nodes and all of them have replicated etcd database. Kubernetes is highly available.

Deployments
Deployment is supervisor in kubernetes cluster. if the application deployed in the cluster is crashed due to some reason, deployment is the object which
takes care of that.
For every program that kubernetes needs to monitor, Kubernetes creates deployment object for that.
Deployment is the desired state of the application running in kubernetes like the containers, no of desired replicas, port no etc.
These kubernetes objects called controller.
Controller also manages the replicas of the programs.

Pod is the kubernetes object that runs multiple containers within. It is also the means of replication. Deployment creates pods.
Actually the replication is handled by another kubernetes object called ReplicaSet. Replica set takes care of pod.
It also manages if the replica is as desired state or not. If lets say there are more than required pods running or less than required
pods running then it will spin up the cluster accordingly.

Deployments manages ReplicaSet. If the deployment is updated, it creates new ReplicaSet to manage new pods. once updated old ReplicaSets are terminated.

All above mentioned things like replica set managing the no of desired replicas or if the pod id deleted then new getting started,
is actually done via scheduler. Scheduler is the component responsible for this process.
when the replica set decides to add more replica its adds the new pod request to kubernetes database. It is then added to
scheduler queue which is schedulers inbox. Schedulers job is to watch through unscheduled job and schedule them.
Scheduler also check which node to assign the pod with some parameters to consider. Then the kubelet taes the pod and starts it.
When we delete the pod the kubelet finds out that this pod shoud be running and adds the pod to schedulers queue.

There are various resources like CPU, Memory, Network bandwidth, Disk IO etc. Kubernetes manages resources for CPU and memory.
we can specify resource requests and resource limits.

Service: manage networking of pods. Also acts as a load balancer out of the box.

======= Lifecycle of containers ====================
Kubernetes restarts containers automatically whenever the container is failed, stopped killed etc.

==> Liveness probes
The service lets say HTTP server should expose some port like /health to specify the liveness of the service.
this can be specified which kubernetes will call and check for its health. if it replies 200 ok or 300 then considered alive.

there are various other probes available like tcp and exec probes.
exec probes are used to execute some command and if that command runs successfully then container is running sorts.

Readiness probe
Sometimes application needs to inform kubernetes that the application needs some time to get ready may be because it
is doing some lengthy initialization process.

Helm:

Helm is a package manager for kubernetes. We can use helm to create resource, manage , update etc. all the resources in our
kubernetes application.

Helm installs a helm chart, which installs all the resources mentioned in helm chart like services, deployments etc. by
creating kubernetes object called Helm release.

Whats inside the helm chart --
the chart is contained in the same named directory as the chart name. lets say demo in our case

demo
|------Chart.yaml
|------values.yaml
|------templates
			|----deployment.yaml
			|----service.yaml
|-----production-values.yaml

Chart.yaml -> contains name and version of chart.
