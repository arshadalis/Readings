There is one thing in common in most of applications today, that is huge data. Also need tp process that data
well in time. there are different uses of data for diff requirements. In today's Internet world everything is
changing very fast. Almost all systems are realtime, process huge data for better services to provide.

There are new advancements in the industry also. New types of databases, various tools etc. But there are few principles
which remain true for applications. Depending upon their need, diff choices of databases should be made.

What any application should be is, Reliable. Doesn't matter dealing with aerospace domain or medical domain or any mundane
application. We are accountable for users data and the system should be reliable.

Data intensive system should be Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable.

## Scalability
It is the ability of the system to cope with the increased data load in system. It is meaningless to say some system
is scalable or it is not scalable.
Rather the question should be 'if system grows in particular way, what are our options to cope with it'
or 'How can we add computing resources to deal with additional load'.

take an example of twitter, where one twit needs to reach to multiple users home timeline if they have subscribed
to it. some users twit continually but some twits rarely but that reaches to millions, so this fan-out is the key
load parameter. all application have diff characteristics so diff params to consider for scaling.
